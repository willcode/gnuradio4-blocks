# Test translation units are dominated by the Block/Graph/Scheduler closure that the module object libraries already
# precompile. A precompiled header takes roughly as long to build as it saves across a handful of translation units, so
# one header per test target, and even one per test directory, would largely pay for itself and no more. The test tier
# shares a single header instead, held by an anchor target that carries the compile options add_ut_test gives its tests.

# Builds the anchor target that owns the shared precompiled header. It compiles one trivial translation unit, so the
# header is its only real output. Its options mirror what add_ut_test gives a test target, because GCC refuses a
# precompiled header built under different settings -- the optimization level among them -- and CMake pairs the header
# with -Winvalid-pch, so under -Werror the refusal stops the build.
#
# The anchor is an executable rather than an object library for the same reason: under CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE
# CMake gives a library -fPIC and an executable -fPIE, and the tests reading this header are executables. It is left out
# of the default targets, so the link its main() allows is one nothing normally asks for.
