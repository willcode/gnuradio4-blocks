@brief Data-aided burst timing: measures a burst's symbol phase from its alternating training sequence and tags it.

A two-level training sequence of alternating symbols is, through an FM discriminator, a real tone at half the symbol
rate. The frequency is known, so that tone's phase is the symbol phase and one dot product measures it — where a timing
loop has to acquire the phase from an unknown start, which a burst gives it too few symbols to do. The block watches the
fraction of a sliding window's energy lying in that bin, takes the first crossing of `threshold`, follows it for one
further window and fires on the best-filled window of that span. One excursion above the threshold is one tag, so a
burst yields exactly one; `hold_off_symbols` additionally silences the block for a stated span after a tag, for a link
whose payload can hold an alternating run as long as its preamble. It is off by default, and a value at or above the
spacing between two bursts' preambles swallows the second burst. The statistic is a ratio, so it needs no AGC and no
absolute level and one threshold serves every link.

The fractional phase a symbol synchronizer acts on rides on `clock_est` in input samples beside the nominal period, or
on `time_est` alone when `preset_period` is false. Naming a `trigger_label` adds the reserved `trigger_name` beside it,
and `trigger_offset` carrying the same phase in the seconds that key declares, which turns the tag into a burst gate as
well; it is off by default because a framer downstream resynchronizes on any trigger tag, and a phase measurement taken
at the end of a training sequence is not where a frame starts. The period in the tag is `sample_rate / symbol_rate`, a
constant of the configuration and not a measurement: a preamble short enough for a burst measures the rate far too
coarsely to be worth presetting, and what the constant buys is that the loop's integrator restarts with each burst
instead of carrying whatever it drifted to across the preceding gap.

`preamble_symbols = 0` disables the block: the stream passes through unchanged and no tag is emitted, which is what lets
one recipe serve a continuous link and a burst one. Enabled, the block holds back one analysis window plus one symbol of
output, because the tag names a sample that can lie a symbol ahead of the read position; that hold-back is the whole
latency, the analysis window itself being history rather than delay, and a tag arriving from upstream rides through at
the call offset the framework gives it rather than being delayed with the stream. `float` only: the statistic is defined
on the real discriminator stream, and an alternating preamble on a complex stream carries a different timing line.
