@brief Symbol timing recovery: estimates the transmitter's symbol clock from the signal and resamples onto it.

The receiver knows roughly how many samples there are per symbol, but not the transmitter's exact clock nor where the
symbol boundaries fall, and both drift. This block estimates the symbol instants from the signal itself and emits
`outputs_per_symbol` samples per symbol taken at those instants. The interpolator's position is advanced by the loop's
period estimate and not derived from its phase.

An AGC is a precondition, as for CostasLoop and FllBandEdge. `detector_gain` is per symbol period and the block
divides by `samples_per_symbol` itself; 0 takes the detector's own gain on a raised-cosine channel of the stated
`rolloff`, which is the right value whenever the transmitter shaped with a matching root-raised cosine. Gardner,
early-late and signal times slope have no gain at all at zero rolloff, and a graph that asks for one is refused
rather than run with a loop that cannot converge. `noise_bandwidth` is normalized to the symbol rate here, the loop
stepping once per symbol, where the carrier loops normalize theirs to the sample rate.

Gardner and early-late are blind and work before the carrier loop has locked; Mueller & Muller, the modified M&M and
zero crossing need decisions, hence a locked carrier and the `constellation` setting. `mmse8` is a clean interpolator
for `sps >= 2.5`; below that use `mmse12` or `polyphase`, which also matched-filters and so must not follow another
matched filter. Output sample `k` estimates the input at a continuous position that is not a fixed multiple of the
output index; `instant_period` and `average_period` carry the clock for a consumer that needs it.

The input port's minimum is held at the count that guarantees one more output, so at end of stream the block ends
as soon as fewer samples than that remain: the trailing samples are dropped, an interpolation without its future
samples being fabrication, and a finite graph terminates instead of waiting on input that cannot arrive.

A `time_est` or `clock_est` tag presets the position, and `clock_est` the period with it, which on a burst link is what
removes the acquisition the loop has too few symbols to do. A preset re-times a sample rather than removing one, so the
stream leaving the block carries one sample per symbol across a tag as it does anywhere else. `trigger` names which
producer's tags to honor and empty honors any; `trigger_presets` turns presetting off altogether. A payload out of
range, one carrying another producer's name, and one whose instant the position has already gone past are each ignored
and counted, and leave the block in the state it would have been in with no tag at all.

     * it cannot serve. Which step carries the snap is what keeps the count of samples intact. A target within half an

     * instant onto it before the step runs. A target further ahead names the instant *after* this one, and the snap
     * replaces the step's own advance instead, so the sample this step carries is still taken at the position the
     * loop holds. A snap taken at a step whose instant it does not name swallows that step's sample, which on a burst
