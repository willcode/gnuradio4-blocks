/**
 * @brief A raw sample stream over ZeroMQ, in the wire format GNU Radio 3.10's `gr-zeromq` publishes.
 *
 * This exists for compatibility and for nothing else. The module's envelope pair speaks a versioned header this
 * fork defines, which no 3.10 flowgraph can produce; `zmq_pub_sink` and `zmq_push_sink` with `pass_tags=false`
 * put nothing on the wire but the items themselves — one message per buffer, `nitems * itemsize` bytes, no header
 * and no framing — and a non-empty `key` prepends the subscription prefix as a frame of its own. A graph built on
 * this block therefore takes a stock 3.10 publisher unchanged, which is what lets a migration move one end at a
 * time. Nothing else about the format is worth adopting: it carries no type, no length and no version, so a peer
 * that changes its item type says so only by producing nonsense.
 *
 * `pass_tags=true` is not read. That variant prefixes a serialized tag header this fork has no reader for, and
 * decoding it would mean carrying a second wire format for the sake of the one it exists to leave behind; a
 * publisher set that way is heard as items and the header lands in the stream as noise.

@brief Receives raw `T` samples over a ZeroMQ SUB or PULL socket and publishes them on `out`, unchanged.

The wire format is `gr-zeromq`'s with `pass_tags=false`: one message per buffer of items, `nitems * sizeof(T)`
bytes and nothing else, preceded by the publisher's `key` as a frame of its own where one is set. A message of any
other shape — a length that is not a whole number of items — is refused and counted rather than spliced in, because
the alternative is a stream whose item boundary is permanently half a sample out and no way to say so.

A dedicated I/O thread owns the context and the socket end to end, because a libzmq socket is a single-thread
object and a scheduler pool worker is not a stable home for one. It appends whole messages to a bounded byte queue;
`processBulk` only drains that queue, so no scheduler thread ever waits on a socket.

The queue drops its oldest samples when a publisher outruns the graph. That is the right end to shed for a live
stream — the newest samples are the ones still worth having — and the sender is pacing the stream anyway, since
neither end of a ZeroMQ link can apply backpressure to a publisher that has already handed its message to the
library. The drop is a whole number of samples, so what a consumer sees across an overrun is a gap and never a
phase shift. `nSamplesDropped` counts them.

A reader that dies other than by request is not a quiet wire, and `processBulk` reports `work::Status::ERROR` once
its queue has drained rather than an endless stream of empty work: `OK` would leave the graph running behind a
permanently flat input with nothing to tell a dead endpoint from an idle one.
