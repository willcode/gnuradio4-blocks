/**
 * @brief A tagged sample stream carried across a process boundary, in the module's own envelope.
 *
 * The record pair next door carries a `gr::Packet<T>`, which is a finished object with its own metadata; this pair
 * carries what a flowgraph edge carries — a continuous stream of `T` and the tags standing in it — so a graph can be
 * cut in two and the halves put in different processes without either half being rewritten. Nothing about the wire
 * changes: the same 32-byte header, the same YAML metadata frame and the same four ZeroMQ frames, at wire version 1.
 * A chunk of samples is simply what the payload holds, and the three facts a stream needs that a packet does not —
 * where the chunk sits in the stream, what tags stand in it and at what offsets, and the rate the stream runs at —
 * ride in the metadata frame under reserved keys.
 *
 * The one property that governs the design is that **a hole in the stream must be visible at the far end**. A
 * subscriber loses packets inside libzmq with no error at either end, so both `sequence` and the absolute
 * `stream_position` cross on every packet, and the receiver announces what is missing as one tag rather than
 * concatenating across it. A stream that silently splices is worse than one that admits a gap: everything
 * downstream of the splice is timed wrongly and nothing says so.

@brief Cuts a tagged stream of T into packets and publishes each as one versioned four-frame ZeroMQ message.

This is where a flowgraph edge leaves the process. `max_items` sets the cut: zero means one packet per work call,
which follows the scheduler's own chunking, and any other value bounds the packet so a downstream latency budget is a
number rather than a consequence of buffer sizing. The envelope is the module's, unchanged and at wire version 1, so
a hand-built peer reads the header and the payload of these messages without knowing that a stream produced them.

Three facts ride in the metadata frame beside `sequence`. `stream_position` is the absolute index of the chunk's
first sample, counted by this block from its own start; it is what lets the far end state the exact span a lost
packet swallowed instead of only that something was lost. `packet_tags` carries the tags standing in the chunk as a
list of `{offset, map}` entries, offsets relative to the chunk's first sample, maps copied key for key with nothing
filtered. `sample_rate` is stated on every packet once the stream has stated one, so a subscriber that joined
mid-stream learns the rate at once rather than waiting for the next tag to come round. Where the stream states none —
the tree's own `SignalGenerator` carries its rate in a setting and never tags it — the `sample_rate` setting is
stated instead; a tag always wins over it, because a tag is the more local truth.

The framework delivers those tags in one of two shapes and the block reads both. A block with no forward tag
propagation has its input span cut at the next tag, so the ordinary case is one tag at relative index 0; where tags
stand closer together than the port's minimum request it cannot cut there, and the span carries several at their own
offsets. Both are the same code path — the span's tag view, offsets clamped into the span — because a block that
only read index 0 would silently drop the second tag of a close pair.

A chunk whose envelope would exceed `max_message_bytes` is refused, counted, and skipped over: `sequence` and
`stream_position` both advance past it, so the far end reports exactly one lost packet and the exact sample span it
covered. The record sink withholds the sequence for a refusal because a refused packet leaves by its `reject` port
and would renumber a stream that still carries it; here the samples are simply gone, and saying so is the only
honest reading.

Everything else is the record sink's contract, for the same reasons: `pub` by default because a `push` sink splits a
stream between two consumers with no error anywhere, and `drop_oldest` by default because a slow subscriber must not
stall the graph.

@brief Receives the stream pair's packets and republishes the samples and the tags standing in them.

This is where the flowgraph edge `StreamPacketSink` cut resumes. The payload becomes samples on `out` and every
carried tag is republished at the same offset it had, so a tag that stood at sample k of the sender's stream stands
at sample k of this one. `sample_rate` is republished as a tag whenever the value changes, which for a subscriber
that joined mid-stream is at its first sample: the rate is a fact the receiving half needs before it can do anything
with the samples, and a subscriber has no way to ask for it.

**A gap is announced, never spliced.** A packet lost inside libzmq costs nothing at either end and is invisible in
the payloads, so the block reconstructs the loss instead: `sequence` says how many packets went missing and
`stream_position` says exactly which samples they held. One tag is published at the next sample, carrying
`n_dropped_samples` (the framework's own key, so a block downstream that already understands dropped samples needs
no new vocabulary), `packets_lost` and `stream_position` — the absolute index of the first missing sample, so the
missing span is `[stream_position, stream_position + n_dropped_samples)`. The check runs where the packet is
published rather than where it arrives, so a packet the in-process queue shed is announced by the same mechanism as
one the wire lost, and `droppedByBackpressure` is what separates the two causes.

A packet is refused for one named reason and counted. The header refusals are the envelope kernel's own, by its
spelling; beyond them a message that is not four frames, whose frame sizes disagree with the header's lengths, that
carries a different item type, or whose payload is not a whole number of items is refused, and so is one that states
no `sequence` and `stream_position`: a packet this block cannot place in the stream is one it cannot honestly
concatenate, and the gap tag exists precisely so that it never has to.

Validation and decoding happen on the block's own reader thread, so a flood of malformed messages costs that thread
and never the scheduler, and the queue the graph drains holds only packets whose shape is established. The queue is
bounded and drops its oldest packet when the graph falls behind, which for a live stream is the right end to shed.

Unlike the record source this block tracks one stream, not one per `source_id`. Two producers on one endpoint
interleave two sample streams into one edge, which no gap tag can describe; a graph that wants two streams uses two
sources.
