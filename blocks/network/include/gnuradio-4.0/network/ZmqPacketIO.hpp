@brief Publishes each incoming gr::Packet<T> as one versioned four-frame ZeroMQ message.

One packet becomes one message of four parts — topic, 32-byte header, metadata, payload — and libzmq guarantees that
a peer receives all four or none, so an envelope is never torn. The header states the item type, item size, item
count, payload length, metadata length, byte order and wire version, so a receiver this process did not build reads
the payload without being told anything out of band. The metadata frame is the packet's own `meta_information[0]`
serialized by `gr::pmt::yaml`, copied key for key with nothing filtered: a producer-private key crosses the process
boundary intact.

`pub` is the default pattern because the failure mode of the alternative is invisible. Two consumers on a `push` sink
each receive half the packets, with no error and no counter anywhere; two on a `pub` sink each receive all of them.
`push` is offered because a lossless hand-off to a decoder that must see every packet is a real requirement, and it
is the pattern to pair with `overflow = "backpressure"`.

A slow subscriber must not be able to stall the flowgraph, so the default `overflow` is `drop_oldest`: the oldest
queued envelope is discarded and counted, the newest is kept, and the receiver sees the loss as a `sequence` gap.
`backpressure` instead consumes fewer input items, so the stall propagates upstream by the framework's own path
rather than by blocking a thread — the honest setting for an offline chain and the wrong one for a radio, where it
trades a counted packet drop for an uncounted sample drop further upstream.

The block fills `sequence` only when the packet does not already carry one. Both values are derived, and the less
local one is the more useful: an upstream `sequence` counts what the original producer emitted, so a gap in it at the
receiver means "lost somewhere between that producer and here", while the sink's own counter can only count what
reached the sink and writing it would renumber the stream and hide upstream loss. Every envelope this sink emits
carries `sequence`, which is what makes loss reconstructible at the far end.

A libzmq socket is a single-thread object and a scheduler pool worker is not a stable home for one, so the block owns
a dedicated I/O thread that creates, uses and closes the socket. `processBulk` serializes and enqueues and never
touches the socket; the I/O thread does nothing but send. Teardown is bounded and discards what is still queued,
counted in `nDroppedAtStop`, because an unbounded drain against a stalled peer is a graph that will not tear down.

@brief Receives versioned four-frame ZeroMQ messages and publishes each as one gr::Packet<T>.

Validation happens on the block's own reader thread, so a flood of malformed messages costs that thread and never the
scheduler, and the queue the graph drains holds only objects whose shape is established. A message is refused for one
named reason — the first that applies — and a refusal is observable three ways at once: the raw bytes go to `reject`
with `discard_reason` in their metadata, a counter increments, and the first envelope of each distinct unsupported
wire version is logged once. Once per distinct value, because a mismatched peer publishing at rate would otherwise
turn a version mismatch into a log flood.

`T` is fixed at compile time, so an envelope whose `item_type` names a different item is refused rather than
converted. Nothing is filtered on the way in: every key of the decoded map reaches `meta_information[0]` at whatever
type it carries, and a vocabulary key at the wrong type is counted rather than dropped — the value's author is in
another process and cannot be told, so dropping the key would erase the only evidence that the peer is misconfigured.

`max_message_bytes` is required and has no default. libzmq's own `ZMQ_MAXMSGSIZE` defaults to no limit, so a source
that did not set it would have the library allocate whatever a peer claims before the block sees a byte. The bound is
pushed into libzmq as well as checked here; the cost of an oversize message is therefore a disconnection, and over a
connection-oriented transport an automatic reconnection, whose loss appears at this end as a `sequence` gap.

Loss is not countable by either end of a ZeroMQ link — a publisher's drops happen inside the library after the send
has already succeeded — so it is reconstructed instead from what arrives. The source tracks the last `sequence` seen
per `source_id`, counts gaps and the packets they imply, and treats a lower value as a producer restart rather than
as loss. Subtracting `nDroppedByBackpressure` from `nPacketsLost` separates what the wire lost from what this graph
was too slow to take. The first envelope from a source is never a gap, because a subscriber has no history and may
legitimately join mid-stream.
