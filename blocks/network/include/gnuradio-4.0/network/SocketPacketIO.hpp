/**
 * @brief The packet envelope over plain TCP and UDP sockets, with no message library between the block and the wire.
 *
 * The envelope these blocks carry is the one `gr::network::encodeHeader` writes, unchanged: the same 32 bytes in a
 * ZeroMQ frame, in a byte stream and in a datagram. What changes is the framing the transport supplies underneath.
 * ZeroMQ hands a reader whole messages; TCP hands it a byte stream with no boundaries at all, and UDP hands it
 * datagrams that may be lost, reordered or duplicated but never torn. Those two facts are the whole of the delta,
 * and they appear here as one state machine and one datagram policy.
 *
 * The topic frame does not exist. It was a subscription artifact, and a TCP connection or a UDP port is one channel,
 * so there is no `topic` and no `pattern` setting anywhere in this file.

@brief Writes each incoming gr::Packet<T> to a TCP peer as one versioned envelope in the byte stream.

One packet becomes `header || metadata || payload` written consecutively, with no delimiter of any kind: the 32-byte
header states both lengths, so a reader finds the next envelope from the header it has just read. The header also
states the item type, item size, item count, byte order and wire version, so a receiver this process did not build
reads the payload without being told anything out of band. The metadata is the packet's own `meta_information[0]`
serialized by `gr::pmt::yaml`, copied key for key with nothing filtered.

A listening sink serves one peer at a time. A second connection is accepted and immediately closed, counted in
`nPeersRefused`, because refusing at accept is the only way the extra client learns anything at all. A connecting
sink retries forever at `reconnect_ms`; a transport does not decide for the graph that an endpoint is gone for good,
so `start()` succeeds whether or not the peer is up yet and only a socket that cannot be created or an endpoint that
cannot be resolved is fatal.

While no peer is connected nothing leaves the queue, so the queue fills and `overflow` decides what happens next. The
default `drop_oldest` discards the stalest envelope and counts it, and the receiver sees the loss as a `sequence` gap;
`backpressure` instead consumes fewer input items, so the stall propagates upstream by the framework's own path.

The block fills `sequence` only when the packet does not already carry one. An upstream `sequence` counts what the
original producer emitted, so a gap in it at the receiver means "lost somewhere between that producer and here",
while this block's own counter can only count what reached the sink.

The socket is owned end to end by a dedicated I/O thread. `processBulk` serializes and enqueues and never touches a
descriptor. Teardown is bounded and discards what is still queued, counted in `nDroppedAtStop`, because an unbounded
drain against a stalled peer is a graph that will not tear down; an envelope lost part-written when a peer disappears
is counted in `nSendErrors` and dropped rather than retried, since the receiver would have to resynchronize past its
truncated prefix either way.

@brief Reads versioned envelopes out of a TCP byte stream and publishes each as one gr::Packet<T>.

A byte stream supplies no message boundaries, so the reader supplies them itself and owes what a message library's
atomicity would otherwise pay for. It holds one buffer and three states.

**Seeking.** Scan for the four magic bytes. Everything the scan passes over is counted in `nBytesSkipped`. Entering
this state counts one `nResyncs` except at a connection's start, where the reader has no alignment to lose: a scan
that has to hunt from a position the reader believed was an envelope boundary counts one, and so does every return
from a header that did not decode.

**Header.** With a magic candidate at the head, accumulate 32 bytes and decode them. A failure means the candidate was
four coincidental bytes or a damaged header: the refusal is counted, no reject packet is published because no body has
been read, the buffer advances one byte past the match and the reader returns to seeking. The header CRC is what makes
that loop terminate at a real header and nowhere else.

**Body.** An envelope whose stated size exceeds `max_message_bytes`, or whose `item_type` is not this block's, is
refused and its body is stepped over **by length rather than buffered** — the CRC-valid header is trusted to size the
skip, which is what the redundant `payload_bytes` field is for, and it is what keeps the stream synchronized through a
refusal. A refusal at this stage therefore publishes no reject packet either, because a reject built from bytes the
reader deliberately did not buffer would be an empty claim. Otherwise the body is accumulated and the metadata parsed,
and a metadata refusal does publish a reject, because those bytes are in hand.

There is no `bad_magic` refusal here and no `length_mismatch`: a stream has no frame sizes to disagree with the header,
and foreign bytes are scanned past rather than named, which is the price of framing that the transport does not supply.

A connection that closes mid-envelope discards the partial envelope and counts it in `nTruncatedEnvelopes`; the loss is
also visible as a `sequence` gap at the next whole envelope. The next connection begins by seeking, because a new
stream owes no alignment to the old one.

The reader dies of its own socket and of nothing else, which is what makes `work::Status::ERROR` mean something. Four
faults end it: the listening socket reporting `POLLERR`, `POLLHUP` or `POLLNVAL`; an `accept` that fails for anything
but a would-block, an interrupt, an aborted connection or a passing shortage of descriptors or memory; a socket the
connecting role cannot create for such a reason; and an endpoint that has stopped resolving, which the connecting role
asks again once a second while it has no peer, so a peer that moves is followed and a name that is gone is fatal. A
shortage retries a bounded number of times before it counts as permanent. What a peer does — closing, resetting,
refusing a connection — costs the connection and nothing more, and the reconnect loop carries on. `nReaderFailures`
counts the reader threads that ended on a fault and `lastReaderError()` names the last one.

Validation happens on the block's own reader thread, so a flood of malformed bytes costs that thread and never the
scheduler, and the queue the graph drains holds only objects whose shape is established. `max_message_bytes` is
required and has no default: it is the bound that decides what a peer's claimed length is allowed to size.

@brief Sends each incoming gr::Packet<T> to a UDP endpoint as exactly one datagram.

An envelope never spans datagrams and a datagram never carries more than one envelope. A datagram is the transport's
own indivisible unit, so aligning the envelope to it means every loss is a whole-envelope loss, visible at the
receiver as a `sequence` gap, and the receiver needs no state across datagrams — reordering and duplication then
degrade into the sequence tracker's existing gap and reset accounting instead of corrupting a reassembly buffer.

There is no `bind` setting, because there is no third arrangement: a datagram sink sends to its endpoint. The socket
is connected to the resolved target once at `start()`, which fixes the destination for every later send and lets the
kernel report an ICMP port-unreachable back as a send error rather than dropping it unattributed.

An envelope larger than `max_datagram_bytes` is refused to `reject` with `discard_reason = "over_max_datagram"` — the
datagram spelling of the stream transports' size refusal. The default `65507` is the IPv4 UDP maximum and admits
envelopes that IP will fragment; a deployment that must avoid fragmentation lowers the setting toward its path MTU,
which this block states rather than probes, because path MTU is a property of a route and not of a block.

A send that fails costs one envelope and never the thread: the error is counted in `nSendErrors`, logged once per
distinct cause, and the next packet is attempted normally.

@brief Receives one envelope per UDP datagram and publishes each as one gr::Packet<T>.

The datagram boundary is the framing, so there is no seeking state and no buffer that outlives one read: a datagram
carries exactly one envelope or it carries a refusal. That is what makes a lost datagram a whole-envelope loss,
visible as a `sequence` gap, and it is why reordering and duplication reach the sequence tracker rather than a
reassembly buffer.

There is no `bind` setting, because there is no third arrangement: a datagram source binds its endpoint. Each
datagram is read with the flag that reports its true length even when the buffer could not hold it, so a datagram
larger than `max_message_bytes` is refused as `"over_max"` from a bounded copy rather than sizing an allocation from a
peer's claim. A datagram shorter than a header is `"short_header"`; one whose length disagrees with
`32 + meta_bytes + payload_bytes` is `"length_mismatch"`, which is the check a byte stream cannot make and a datagram
can. Every refusal here publishes a reject packet, because the datagram is fully in hand.

Validation happens on the block's own reader thread, so a flood of malformed datagrams costs that thread and never the
scheduler. `max_message_bytes` is required and has no default: it is the bound that decides how much of a datagram
this block is willing to hold.

The reader dies of its own socket and of nothing else, which is what makes `work::Status::ERROR` mean something: the
bound socket reporting `POLLERR`, `POLLHUP` or `POLLNVAL`, or a read failing for a reason that is the descriptor's
rather than one datagram's. A peer that cannot be reached, a datagram that arrives malformed and a port that answers
with an ICMP refusal are all counted and read past, because a datagram socket outlives any one datagram; a shortage of
descriptors or memory is retried a bounded number of times before it counts as permanent. `nReaderFailures` counts the
reader threads that ended on a fault and `lastReaderError()` names the last one.
