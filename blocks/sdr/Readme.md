# SDR blocks

The `gr::blocks::sdr` family reaches SDR hardware through
[SoapySDR](https://github.com/pothosware/SoapySDR) (Boost-1.0). The family is
off by default (`GR4_ENABLE_SDR`). Its blocks, the loopback device and the tests
that use them build only where SoapySDR is found.

## Blocks

`SoapySource<T>` receives one or more channels from a SoapySDR device, and
`SoapySink<T>` transmits one or more. Each runs a dedicated IO thread. Each
block opens its device by the driver name merged with its `device_parameter`
arguments. A sink and a source with the same driver and device parameters share
one device handle. The registered sample types are `std::uint8_t`,
`std::int16_t` and `std::complex<float>`.

`DcBlocker.hpp` and `Saturate.hpp` are plain headers and need no SoapySDR.

## Loopback device

`LoopbackDevice.hpp` and `src/SoapyLoopbackModule.cpp` implement a SoapySDR
device with the driver name `loopback`. It routes transmitted samples through a
per-channel model to the receive side. The build produces it twice for the
tests: the static library `gr-sdr-loopback-static`, which tests link, and the
SoapySDR module `gr-sdr-loopback`, which tests load. Neither is installed.

## Tests

- `qa_DcBlocker`, `qa_Saturate`, `qa_SdrHeaderOrder` and
  `qa_apptest_SdrBlockLibrary` open no device.
- `qa_SoapyLoopback` links the static loopback device.
- `qa_SoapyRaiiWrapper`, `qa_SoapyIntegration` and `qa_SoapySinkBurst` load
  the loopback module. ctest runs them with `SOAPY_SDR_PLUGIN_PATH` set to the
  test directory that holds a copy of it.
- `qa_SoapySource` loads the loopback module, and opens attached hardware only
  on request (below).

The four loopback tests are skipped where `ldd` finds that the SoapySDR
library links a different C++ standard library from this project's.
`qa_SoapySource` then runs without its device cases.

## Running the SoapySDR tests

`qa_SoapySource` runs against the loopback SoapySDR module built with this
family. Its ctest registration and the program itself set `SOAPY_SDR_ROOT` to an
empty directory and `SOAPY_SDR_PLUGIN_PATH` to the loopback module's directory.
SoapySDR then loads no module of the host and opens no attached radio:

```sh
ctest --test-dir <build-dir> -R qa_SoapySource
```

The hardware cases run against the host's modules and attached radios only
when the binary runs directly with `GR_SDR_TEST_HARDWARE=1`:

```sh
GR_SDR_TEST_HARDWARE=1 <build-dir>/blocks/sdr/test/qa_SoapySource
```

With the variable set, each hardware case runs only when enumeration lists its
driver (`rtlsdr` or `lime`), and `DISABLE_SENSITIVE_TESTS` in the environment
runs none of them. The parameterized Basic API test opens the loopback device
always and every other listed device under the same rule. The ctest
registration keeps the loopback module alone whatever the variable says.
