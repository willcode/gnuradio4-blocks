/**
 * Rate matching by puncturing: a stated mask deletes coded bits on the way out, and the receiving
 * end puts erasures back where they stood.
 *
 * The mask is a string of '1' and '0' characters — keep and delete — applied cyclically over the
 * coded stream in the encoder's own output order, one bit per polynomial with the polynomials in
 * the order they were given. The string form is chosen so that a published rate-compatible pattern
 * transcribes without reordering: such patterns are quoted as matrices read column by column, and a
 * column-major read of an n-row matrix in polynomial order is exactly this string. The classic
 * rate-2/3 and rate-3/4 punctures of the (171, 133) code are spelled "1110" and "111001" here.
 *
 * The mask's length is not tied to the number of polynomials. A pattern is a property of the coded
 * stream rather than of one encoder step, and the useful published patterns walk across step
 * boundaries: rate 3/4 from rate 1/2 has a period of six over steps of two.
 *
 * The phase resets at every record. A record is one frame, so a frame's puncturing is reproducible
 * in isolation — what a stored or forwarded frame needs — and the two blocks agree on phase by
 * construction rather than through a counter they would have to keep in step.
 *
 * Puncture carries bit items and Depuncture soft ones, on the convolutional adapters' conventions:
 * one std::uint8_t per bit with the low bit holding the value, and one float per coded bit with the
 * sign carrying the bit and the magnitude the confidence. A deleted position comes back as 0.0F,
 * the convention's pure erasure, which is precisely the value the Viterbi correlation metric weighs
 * at nothing. There is no hard-decision counterpart, because a hard word has nowhere to say that a
 * bit is missing rather than zero.
 *
 * Neither block writes metadata. Puncturing is an encoder-side act with no status, and an inserted
 * erasure is the pattern's own fact rather than a report about the channel; the decoder's
 * `corrected_errors` already accounts for what the channel and the puncturing together cost.
 *
 * The pattern is immutable configuration rather than a live setting, for the reason the code is:
 * both ends of a link agree on it before the first bit.

/*!
@brief Puncture: a record of coded bits in, the bits the pattern keeps out.

The record's bits are walked with the pattern from phase zero, positions marked '1' being kept in
order and positions marked '0' dropped. The pattern needs no alignment with the record's end, so any
nonzero length punctures; only an empty record is refused, counted in `nRecordsRefused` and stated
at `stop()`, and the record after it is punctured normally.

An encoder-side rate match has no status to report, so the record's metadata crosses unchanged; its
signal name and its single-map shape follow it, and the output record's extent names its own length.

A record whose length is not a whole number of pattern periods punctures here but is refused by
Depuncture, whose contract is stated on its own declaration. Framing a chain in whole periods is the
sender's business, and the receiver counts what does not fit rather than guessing at it.

GR_REGISTER_BLOCK(gr::blocks::fec::Depuncture)

/*!
@brief Depuncture: a record of the soft values that survived the puncture in, the coded frame with
erasures at the deleted positions out.

The pattern is walked from phase zero over the output. Every position marked '1' takes the next
input value and every position marked '0' becomes 0.0F, the soft convention's pure erasure, which
the Viterbi correlation metric weighs at nothing.

The output's length is the input's kept count expanded back over whole periods of the pattern: an
input of `m` values under a pattern keeping `w` of every `p` positions becomes `(m / w) * p` values.
An input whose length is not a whole multiple of `w` therefore has no length to expand to and is a
counted, stated drop, as is an empty record; the record after it is depunctured normally. The pair
is an exact inverse on records whose length is a whole number of pattern periods, which is the
domain a chain frames itself onto — outside it a kept count cannot name the length it came from,
because the deleted positions at a record's end leave no trace in what was sent.

Nothing is written to metadata; every key crosses verbatim. An inserted erasure is the pattern's own
fact, and the decoder's `corrected_errors` already reports what the channel and the puncturing
together cost.
