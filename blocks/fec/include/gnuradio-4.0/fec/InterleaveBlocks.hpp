/**
 * The record-native adapters over the interleaver families in `gnuradio-4.0/algorithm/fec`.
 *
 * An interleaver spreads a burst. A channel that destroys a run of adjacent items hands a decoder
 * a run of adjacent errors, which is the one shape a code with a small correcting radius cannot
 * take; moving the items apart before the channel and back afterwards turns that run into single
 * errors scattered over a frame, which is the shape every code is designed for. Nothing here
 * reads an item's value, so the whole layer is addressing arithmetic and the item type is the
 * carrier's business rather than the family's.
 *
 * The carrier is the bit record the other adapters in this module speak: a
 * `DataSet<std::uint8_t>` with one item per bit or per symbol, the value untouched from one end
 * to the other. A symbol-width consumer packs before this block and unpacks after it — the
 * families move items and a wider item is a different packing, not a different interleaver.
 * The framed kinds also carry `DataSet<float>`, the soft record a soft-decision chain
 * deinterleaves before its decoder: a permutation never reads a value, so the float
 * registration is addressing arithmetic over a different carrier and nothing more.
 *
 * One block pair carries all three families, selected by an immutable `kind` setting. The
 * settings surfaces barely overlap, but the record contract, the counted drops and the counters
 * are identical across them, and three pairs would state that contract three times.
 *
 * - **`block`** takes `rows` and `cols`, and — on `Interleave` only — optionally the
 *   `window_offset` and `window_length` of a readout that covers only part of the interleaved
 *   frame. One record must hold a whole number of frames.
 * - **`convolutional`** takes `branches` and `unit_delay`. It is the one family here whose state
 *   crosses a record boundary: it is stream-shaped, any record length is valid, and splitting a
 *   stream into different records gives the same output items. The end-to-end
 *   interleave-to-deinterleave delay is `branches * (branches - 1) * unit_delay` items and the
 *   initial fill emits `fill_value` rather than swallowing items, so the output is 1:1 with the
 *   input from the first item.
 * - **`permutation`** takes an explicit `table`, required with no default: a published table is
 *   an interoperability constant and a default would be an interoperability assumption nobody
 *   made.
 *
 * **Metadata carry.** The framed kinds turn one record into one record and the record's facts
 * cross verbatim. The convolutional kind produces a span whose items came from several earlier
 * records, and the output record carries the facts of the record that held the *first* item of
 * that span — the only causal choice, since that is the record the span begins in. While the
 * delay lines are still filling, the span's first item came from the fill rather than from any
 * record, and the output then carries the facts of the record being consumed.
 *
 * The family and its shape are immutable configuration rather than live settings. Both ends of a
 * link agree on an interleaver before the first item, so changing one makes a different chain,
 * which is what rebuilding a graph is for.

GR_REGISTER_BLOCK(gr::blocks::fec::Interleave, [T], [ std::uint8_t, float ])

/*!
@brief Interleave: item records in, the same items in the family's permuted order out.

The framed kinds — `block` and `permutation` — turn one record into one record. A record's length
must be a nonzero multiple of the family's frame, and each frame becomes `rows * cols` items, or
the window's length where `kind` is `block` and a window is set. A record whose length fails that
test is dropped and counted in `nRecordsRefused`, one line at `stop()` reports the total, and the
record after it is interleaved normally: the record producers in this tree cannot emit a misaligned
record except through a fault, and the counter is where such a fault becomes visible.

The `convolutional` kind is stream-shaped. Any nonzero length is a valid record, the output is 1:1
with the input from the first item, and the delay lines keep their contents across records, so the
same stream cut into different records interleaves identically. Only an empty record is refused.
It carries bytes only: a `float` block refuses it at configure, because its fill and its
across-record state have no float semantics and no consumer asks.

An interleaver has no status to report, so the record's facts cross unchanged; its signal name and
its single-map shape follow it, and the output record's extent names its own length. Which record's
facts a convolutional output inherits is the file's stated rule. See Deinterleave for the
counterpart that puts the items back.

/*!
@brief Deinterleave: the interleaved items in, the original order out.

The inverse of Interleave under the same settings, item for item. The `convolutional` kind runs
the complementary delay set, so an interleave followed by a deinterleave delays the stream by
exactly `branches * (branches - 1) * unit_delay` items and changes nothing else about it; it
carries bytes only, as on Interleave.

`output_offset` and `output_length` window the DEINTERLEAVED frame: the emitted record is items
`[output_offset, output_offset + output_length)` of each frame, with a length of 0 meaning "to
the end of the frame", and the record's extent names the emitted length. A distributed sync word
occupies the deinterleaved frame's first items, so `output_offset` at the word's item count hands
the decoder the coded block alone. The window addresses a frame, so the stream-shaped
`convolutional` kind refuses it. Interleave's readout window is a different thing — a partial
readout of the INTERLEAVED frame on the transmit side — and deliberately has no counterpart here:
the pair's inverse relationship must not depend on two settings agreeing.

Length refusals, the counters and the metadata carry are Interleave's, unchanged.
