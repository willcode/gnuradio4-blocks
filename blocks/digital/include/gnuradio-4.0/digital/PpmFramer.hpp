@brief Reads pulse-position frames out of a magnitude or complex stream, one `DataSet<uint8_t>` per frame.

The framer for a burst that arrives out of noise with no carrier before it and no stream after it. Pulse-position
modulation compares the two halves of one bit period with each other, so there is no clock to recover and no
amplitude to track, and a frame is read wherever the preamble's shape appears. `profile` selects the framing:
`mode_s` is ICAO Annex 10 Volume IV's 1090 MHz reply, four preamble pulses at 0.0, 1.0, 3.5 and 4.5 microseconds,
data from 8.0, and a frame of 56 or 112 bits chosen by the downlink format's top bit.

At `float` the input is magnitude, `|x|` and not `|x|^2`: the nomination is a ratio and the bit decision a
comparison, so both are free of any positive scaling, but `threshold` is a number on magnitude and would be its
square on power. `gr::blocks::basic::Abs<std::complex<float>>` produces the stream this instantiation wants on its
`abs` port.

At `std::complex<float>` the samples themselves arrive and every position is decided at the sub-sample phase its
preamble sits on. A pulse whose edges fall between two samples spills part of itself into the neighboring gap slot,
which is the shape test's own denominator, and at the two samples a bit period the common receivers deliver that is
the difference between a frame read and a frame missed. So a position first passes a coarse test at
`threshold * coarse_ratio`, and is then re-tested at `phase_steps` offsets spanning one sample period; the offset
whose least pulse slot stands highest above its greatest gap slot decides both the nomination and the bits, and
travels on the record as `sample_phase`. A frame's timing is then `sample_start + sample_phase`: an admitted frame
takes its window from the first position that passed, which can be the sample before the one its preamble sits
nearest, and the offset compensates. `phase_steps` and `coarse_ratio` are read only by this instantiation.

`sample_rate` must be an even integer multiple of 1 MHz, so a half-microsecond slot is a whole number of samples;
2 MS/s is the rate the common receivers deliver and anything else resamples upstream. A `sample_rate` tag overrides
the setting for the samples after it, and a tagged rate that is not such a multiple is a counted refusal that
leaves the previous rate standing.

The parity is checked here rather than downstream because the remainder decides containment: an admitted frame
consumes its whole window and no position inside it is nominated, while every other nomination advances the search
by one sample, so a false nomination cannot swallow the real frame behind it. The remainder travels on every
record — zero on an admitted frame, and the aircraft address on the formats that transmit the parity XORed with
one. Short frames carry no self-checking parity and CRC-failed long frames were never vouched for, so neither is
published unless `emit_short` or `emit_unchecked` asks for it.

The samples not yet decided about are held in a buffer whose bound is fixed at `start()` from the rate and the
framing, so a consumer that stops taking records cannot grow it with the stream: samples past that bound are dropped
and counted, oldest first.
