 * Every rejection throws `gr::exception` quoting the value that caused it, so an invalid configuration stops the graph

 * reading, their `std::invalid_argument` rewrapped under the setting's name rather than a second parser being written
 * beside them. The generator is built beside the running one and moved into place only once every value has been
 * accepted, so a rejected setting leaves the configuration it was applied to intact rather than half moved.
 *
 * Three mask sources are alternatives and at most one may be staged: `taps` with `seed`, a named `profile`, or an
 * explicit `sequence`. A profile fills `taps`, `seed`, `bits_per_item` and `bit_order` outright, so a value staged
 * beside it would leave two answers to one question; `bits_per_item` and `bit_order` carry defaults and cannot be told
 * from an explicit staging, so the profile's values simply win there and the refusal covers `taps`, `seed` and
 * `sequence`, which are the settings that are empty until somebody names them.

@brief XORs the stream with a free-running LFSR sequence, so that what goes on the air looks like noise whatever the data is.

A transmitter sending a long run of identical bits gives the clock recovery loop nothing to lock to, drifts the AGC,
feeds the DC blocker real signal and grows discrete lines where the spectrum should be flat. This block fixes all of it
in one place. The sequence is a function of `taps` and `seed` alone, so the whitening does not depend on the data and a
channel bit error costs exactly one output bit error, which is as well behaved as anything in a receive chain gets.

The price is that both ends must agree on the phase: one bit of phase error leaves the descrambled stream agreeing with
the truth at chance, and nothing inside the block can tell, because there is nothing to compare against. The detection
belongs downstream at a CRC. Three mechanisms reach the epoch boundary the two ends agree on — `start()` and any
setting that reconfigures the generator; a tag carrying `reset_tag_key`, which resets before the tagged item so that
item is the first of the new epoch; and `reset_period` items since the last reset of any cause. At most one reset
happens at any item, and a tag re-anchors the period. The receive side finds its boundary in a detector's
`trigger_name` tag, which is the default key; the transmit side counts it, which is what `reset_period` is for.

XOR is an involution, so this block descrambles as well as it scrambles and there is no second name for the same code.

`taps` is a list of feedback delays rather than a polynomial's exponents, because a three-term polynomial is written
both ways and the standards disagree on which their spelling means: CCSDS's `x^8 + x^7 + x^5 + x^3 + 1` is `"1,3,5,8"`
while IEEE 802.11's `x^7 + x^4 + 1` is `"4,7"`, each confirmed by the sequence its own standard publishes. There is no
default polynomial and no default seed, and the block refuses to start without both, because a scrambler is an
agreement between two ends and an arbitrary default guarantees only that the other end disagrees.

Two other ways of naming the same mask are alternatives to `taps` and `seed`, and staging more than one of the three is
a refusal rather than a merge. `profile` names a published agreement -- `ccsds131`, `ccsds131_17` or `pn9` -- and fills
`taps`, `seed`, `bits_per_item` and `bit_order` from it; it is never a default, and the multiplicative `g3ruh` is
refused here naming its family, because a self-synchronizing agreement run additively is a silent wrong answer.
`sequence` supplies the mask outright as hexadecimal bytes, which is how about half the vendor deframers state theirs.
An explicit sequence of `S` bits either tiles the epoch, which is what a period-`S` recursion would do and cannot lose
whitening, or covers its first `S` bits and leaves the rest unscrambled -- every such item counted in
`nUnscrambledItems` and stated at `stop()`, since a 1:1 block cannot drop an item. Where a periodic epoch is known in
advance to outlast the sequence the shortfall is arithmetic and `start()` refuses it.

The block is 1:1, so every input tag key passes through at its own offset; the reset tag is read and forwarded, never
consumed, and `sample_rate` leaves with the value it arrived with.

The carrier is a bit stream or a bit record. On the `DataSet<std::uint8_t>` instantiation one record is one epoch —
the generator resets at the first item of every record, which is 10.4.3's own rule once extraction has made one
record one codeblock — so no tag can reset on the wrong detector and no period needs counting: `reset_tag_key`,
`reset_tag_value` and `reset_period` are inert there. The record's metadata, name and shape cross verbatim, XOR
being an involution with no status to report.

@brief Feeds the transmitted bits back through the shift register: `out[k] = in[k] XOR f(out, k)`.

The transmit half of the self-synchronizing pair. Where an additive scrambler needs the two ends to agree on a phase,
this one needs no boundary agreement at all: MultiplicativeDescrambler's register holds only received bits, so its
output is correct `degree` bits after it starts, from any state and from any offset into the stream. That is what a
continuous link with no framing to lean on uses, and it is why the V-series modems and 802.3's 64B/66B scramble this
way while CCSDS, DVB and 802.11's OFDM PHY, all framed, scramble additively. The polynomial does not decide which
family a link is in: 802.11 uses the same `"4,7"` additively in its OFDM PHY and self-synchronizingly in its DSSS PHY.

It is paid for twice. One channel bit error becomes `1 + tapCount` errors at the descrambler, which is the number that
decides whether the scrambler goes inside or outside a forward error correcting code. And the whitening depends on the
data, unlike the additive family's: an all-zero register carrying an all-zero input is a fixed point that emits zeros
for ever, and for any seed there is an input -- one equal to the feedback at every step -- that holds the output at a
constant for as long as it continues. The V-series answer to that is `force_transition_after` with `monitor_delays`,
which both ends compute from the transmitted stream alone: the counter runs while `y[k-p] XOR y[k-q]` stays zero and a
complement is injected at the `N`-th such item. Because the monitor reads only what is on the wire, the descrambler
computes the same counter from the same bits and stays exactly this block's inverse -- so the rule is a setting after
all, not a protocol. What it cannot do is bound the output's run length: the pair is a bijection on bit streams, so for
every output, the constant one included, there is exactly one input producing it. What it does do is destroy the
lock-up: fed the plain recursion's own lock-up input, the output stops being constant within `N` items.
`nForcedTransitions` counts the firings, and a chain whose count is zero is a chain that could have set `N` to zero.

`seed` is the `degree` bits assumed to precede the stream, oldest first, and an empty seed means all zeros and is
legal, because those bits reach only the first `degree` bits of an epoch. Resetting therefore buys reproducibility
rather than correctness: the same data with the same seed at the same boundaries produces the same transmitted bits.

`profile` names a published agreement -- `g3ruh`, the 9600-baud packet-radio scrambler -- and fills `taps`, `seed`,
`bits_per_item` and `bit_order` from it, refusing to merge with any of them and refusing an additive profile naming its
family. `taps`, the three reset mechanisms and the tag policy are AdditiveScrambler's, unchanged.

The block is 1:1, so every input tag key passes through at its own offset; the reset tag is read and forwarded, never
consumed, and `sample_rate` leaves with the value it arrived with.

    using Description = Doc<R""(
@brief Feeds the received bits forward through the shift register: `out[k] = in[k] XOR f(in, k)`.

The inverse of MultiplicativeScrambler, exact from item 0 when both carry the same seed. Its register holds nothing but
received bits, so once `degree` of them have arrived every bit in it is data and the output is correct from there on
whatever the register started as -- from a wrong seed, from a mid-stream join, from any offset at all. That is what
self-synchronizing means, and it is why a reset here is a convenience rather than a requirement: a reset changes at
most the first `degree` output bits of an epoch and nothing else. The contrast with the additive family is the whole
argument for this one, and it is stark: an additive descrambler one bit out of phase agrees with the truth at chance
for ever, with nothing inside the block able to tell.

What it costs is error multiplication. One channel bit error becomes `1 + tapCount` output errors -- three for a
two-tap polynomial -- so on a link with forward error correction this number is what decides whether the scrambler
goes inside the code or outside it.

`seed` is the `degree` bits assumed to precede the stream, oldest first, and an empty seed means all zeros and is
legal. `profile`, `invert_output`, `force_transition_after` and `monitor_delays` are MultiplicativeScrambler's and must
carry the same values it does: the monitor reads only the transmitted stream, so both ends compute the same counter
from the same bits and this block stays the exact inverse -- from item 0 with the same seed, and from item `degree`
with any other. `taps`, the three reset mechanisms and the tag policy are AdditiveScrambler's, unchanged.

The block is 1:1, so every input tag key passes through at its own offset; the reset tag is read and forwarded, never
consumed, and `sample_rate` leaves with the value it arrived with.
