@brief Changes the sample rate by a real number, realized exactly as a stated rational.

A caller whose ratio is a fraction of small terms wants `RationalResampler`, at half the arithmetic and no
interpolation error. What this block buys is a bounded filter: the prototype is designed once for a bank of `L` arms
and its length per arm never follows the ratio's arithmetic.

The rate is a `double` and the phase is fixed-point, so the realized ratio is a rational the block reports through
`realizedRate()`, within `1.2e-10` relative of the request. Lowering `rate` past what the prototype was cut for
rebuilds it; `min_rate` states that floor once and keeps the design search off the settings path. The ports are
`Async`, an arbitrary `double` ratio not being expressible as the framework's constant `L:M`. `rate = 1` is not a
pass-through.

A forwarded `sample_rate` tag is multiplied by `rate`, so downstream reads the rate of the stream this block hands it.

Every forwarded tag that marks a time position, such as a trigger, a burst edge or a time stamp, moves by the
prototype's delay `d`, in samples of the interpolated rate `L*fs_in`: a tag on input `i` leaves on the output nearest
the interpolated position `i*L + d`, the sample that carries the energy of input `i`. A tag that states a property of
the stream, such as `sample_rate`, `signal_name` or `context`, crosses unmoved, to the output of input `i` itself. A
designed or other symmetric prototype of `N` taps delays by `(N-1)/2`. An asymmetric supplied prototype moves its tags
by the centroid of its energy, rounded to the whole interpolated sample. A tag is placed when its sample is consumed and
keeps that output whatever rate change or rebuild follows, and a tag whose output lies past the end of the stream is not
published. )"">;
