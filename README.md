# GNU Radio 4.0 Blocks

`gnuradio4-blocks` provides the standard C++23 block libraries for GNU Radio 4.
It builds against installed
[`gnuradio4-core`](https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio4-core) and
[`gnuradio4-library`](https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio4-library) SDKs and
installs blocks, public headers, runtime block libraries, and CMake targets for
applications and out-of-tree block projects.

This repository is one part of the split GNU Radio 4 source tree:

- [`gnuradio4-core`](https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio4-core): runtime,
  scheduler, graph and block model, plugin support, and block-development SDK
- [`gnuradio4-library`](https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio4-library): reusable,
  non-block DSP algorithms built on core
- `gnuradio4-blocks`: standard blocks built on core and the algorithm library

## What's Included?

The default build contains:

- basic signal, function, and clock sources; converters; selectors; triggers;
  synchronization, data sinks, and stream-to-data-set blocks
- arithmetic, expression-evaluation, complex rotator
- FIR, IIR, Savitzky-Golay, and SVD filters, plus frequency estimation and
  decimation
- FFT blocks and benchmarks
- File I/O sources and sinks
- HTTP source and sink blocks
- common device utilities and testing, monitoring, delay, and null-source blocks

Audio source/sink blocks and SDR support for RTL2832 devices and SoapySDR are
available as opt-in block modules. The tree also contains native and Emscripten
examples for GPS, RTL2832, and audio-related workflows where their corresponding
modules and toolchains are enabled.

## Building

The project requires CMake 3.27 or newer, a C++23 compiler, and compatible
installations of the `gnuradio4`, `gnuradio4Library`, and `GnuRadioBlockLib`
CMake packages. A default test build also requires Boost.UT and cpp-httplib.
Point `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` at the prefix containing the installed core and
library SDKs:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio4-blocks.git
cd gnuradio4-blocks

cmake -S . -B build \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/gnuradio4-prefix
cmake --build build --parallel
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Install into the prefix used by the rest of the GNU Radio 4 environment:

```bash
cmake --install build --prefix /path/to/gnuradio4-prefix
```

Useful configuration options are:

- `ENABLE_EXAMPLES` (default: `ON`): build examples and benchmarks
- `ENABLE_TESTING` (default: `ON`): build and register tests
- `GR4_ENABLE_AUDIO` (default: `OFF`): build audio blocks; native builds use
  libsoundio, while Emscripten builds use the Web Audio backend
- `GR4_ENABLE_SDR` (default: `OFF`): build RTL2832 support and, when found,
  SoapySDR source/sink support
- `GR4_ENABLE_HTTP_TESTS` (default: `OFF`): enable HTTP integration tests
- `GR_USE_FETCHCONTENT_DEPS` (default: `OFF`): allow CMake to fetch Boost.UT
- `USE_CCACHE` (default: `ON`): use `ccache` when available
- `GR4_PKG_VERSION` (default: `4.0.0-git`): version recorded in the installed
  `gnuradio4Blocks.pc` metadata

## Using the Blocks

An installation exports the camel-case `gnuradio4Blocks` CMake package and
targets in the `gnuradio4::` namespace. Link the interface target for the block
family whose headers you use; for example:

```cmake
find_package(gnuradio4Blocks CONFIG REQUIRED)

add_executable(my_flowgraph main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_flowgraph PRIVATE gnuradio4::gr-basic)
```

Other installed family targets include `gnuradio4::gr-common`,
`gnuradio4::gr-testing`, `gnuradio4::gr-electrical`, `gnuradio4::gr-fileio`,
`gnuradio4::gr-filter`, `gnuradio4::gr-fourier`, `gnuradio4::gr-http`, and
`gnuradio4::gr-math`. Public headers are installed below
`include/gnuradio-4.0`.

## Formatting and Restyled

Pull requests run [Restyled](https://restyled.io/) against every file changed by
the PR. The repository's `.restyled.yaml` limits that check to the same formatter
set used by `gnuradio4-core` and `gnuradio4-library`:

- clang-format 18 for C and C++
- cmake-format for CMake files
- Prettier for Markdown and YAML
- shellcheck for shell scripts
- Black for Python
- a general whitespace check

The CI job uses `fail-on-differences`, so it fails whenever one of those tools
would modify a changed file. The formatted result must be committed to the PR
branch before the check will pass.

The preferred local workflow uses the formatter versions pinned in
`.pre-commit-config.yaml`. Follow the official
[pre-commit installation instructions](https://pre-commit.com/), then install
the Git hook from the repository root:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

The installed hook formats and validates staged files when committing. To check
and format the entire tree explicitly before submitting a PR, run:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Some hooks modify files on their first pass. Review those changes, stage them,
and run the command again; a clean second run matches the expected Restyled
result. To process only currently staged files, use:

```bash
pre-commit run
```

Alternatively, run the actual Restyled pipeline locally with the
[Restyler CLI](https://github.com/restyled-io/restyler) and Docker. From the
repository root, run:

```bash
restyle \
  --no-commit \
  --no-clean \
  --fail-on-differences \
  .
```

This reads `.restyled.yaml`, runs the configured formatter containers, and
formats files in place. It exits nonzero when it makes changes. Review and commit
those changes, then run the command again; a clean second run should pass. The
`--no-clean` option prevents Restyle from removing untracked files, while
`--no-commit` leaves all formatter changes for review. Running against `.` checks
the entire repository; the GitHub check limits its input to files changed by the
pull request.

The formatter policies are defined by `.clang-format`, `.cmake-format.yaml`, and
`.pre-commit-config.yaml`. Avoid substituting another formatter or version,
because it may produce a different layout and fail the CI comparison.

### Block namespaces and registry names

Public block types and their plugin registry names use the namespace of their
owning block module:

| Module target | C++ namespace and registry prefix |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `audio`       | `gr::blocks::audio::`             |
| `basic`       | `gr::blocks::basic::`             |
| `electrical`  | `gr::blocks::electrical::`        |
| `fileio`      | `gr::blocks::fileio::`            |
| `filter`      | `gr::blocks::filter::`            |
| `fourier`     | `gr::blocks::fourier::`           |
| `http`        | `gr::blocks::http::`              |
| `math`        | `gr::blocks::math::`              |
| `sdr`         | `gr::blocks::sdr::`               |
| `testing`     | `gr::blocks::testing::`           |
| `timing`      | `gr::blocks::timing::`            |

For example, use `gr::blocks::math::Multiply<float>` in C++ and
`gr::blocks::math::Multiply<float32>` as its registry key. New blocks must
follow the same `gr::blocks::<module>::<block>` convention for both their
concrete C++ type and any quoted alias supplied to `GR_REGISTER_BLOCK`.

Deprecated C++ namespace aliases or imports preserve source compatibility with
the former flat `gr::<module>` names. They are a temporary migration aid and are
not emitted as plugin registry aliases: serialized flowgraphs and runtime
registry clients must use the canonical names above. Code that declares new
members inside a compatibility namespace must migrate to the canonical namespace.

## SDK Images

Pushes to `main` publish profile-specific SDK images to the GitHub Container
Registry. They contain compatible core, algorithm-library, and default blocks
installations under `/opt/gnuradio4`:

```text
ghcr.io/gnuradio/gnuradio4-blocks-sdk:<sha-or-main>-<platform>-<compiler>-<profile>
```

Published profiles cover the Ubuntu 24.04 GCC 14 and Clang 20, Ubuntu 26.04
GCC, and Fedora 44 Clang workflow variants. Use a complete tag such as
`main-ubuntu-24.04-gcc14-release`; no generic `main` tag is published. The SDK
image is configured with examples, tests, audio, and SDR disabled.
